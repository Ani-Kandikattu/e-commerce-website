## [Description](#table-of-contents)

In this project, I was tasked with building the backend for an e-commerce website for storing databases and tables for categories, products and tags. This project uses mysql, express.js, and sequelize to create that back end using ORM. I learned how to utilize these technologies properly through the process of creating the back end functionality. 

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

You can clone the github repository to your local device and run npm install in order to install all the required dependencies.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

After running npm install, you must create a .env file and input your own username and password for mysql. After logging in to mysql, you can source the schema.sql file. Once that is done, run npm run seed and then npm start in order to activate the program. You can then use Insomnia or other applications to view the contents.

## [Credits](#table-of-contents)

The initial code was provided by the bootcamp and I modified the files that were required to be modified in order to make the application work.
